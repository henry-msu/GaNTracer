# Allows the user to set the offset calibration of the temperature sensor

# note about GPIOs:
# The SPI module takes up the first 4 pins, so gpios start at ADBUS4.
# This is not compensated for automatically in pyftdi. To read GPIO0,
# you actually read ADBUS4, and so on. Additionally, our board is
# only using 3 gpio pins (ADBUS4, ADBUS5, and ADBUS6). The functions
# readGPIOs() and readGPIO(num) take all this into account and handle
# everything properly.
